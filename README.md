# The game
Utilizing the game is remarkably straightforward. With each turn, a shape and a progress bar will emerge on the screen. As time winds down, the team's task is to embody the displayed shape using their bodies. Once the shape is recreated, the turn transitions to the opposing team, who faces the same challenge. At the conclusion of each round, the computer discerns the victorious team.
